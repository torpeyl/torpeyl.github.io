                        I am a 3rd year Electronics and Information Engineering MEng student at Imperial College London. I enjoy triathlon in my spare time and working on personal electronics and programming projects.<br>

                        •	This had an LCD display that displayed a colour wheel and cursor on it.<br>
                        •	A joystick could be used to move the cursor around the screen thus allowing the light colour to be changed.<br>
                        •	The custom PCB was designed using KiCad.<br>
                        •	The project required the use of SPI, TWI, PWM and DMX protocols.<br>
                        •	The brains of the project was an ATmega1284-P microcontroller with an ATmega48P for additional peripherals.<br>
                        •	The microcontrollers were programmed using embedded C in Microchip Studio.<br>

                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Project Summary</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This is a project that I’ve been working on in my spare time with another electrical engineering student who is working predominantly on the sensors themselves. I’ve been responsible for the system architecture, as well as setting up the website, server and writing the APIs. Over the course of the project a number of different sensors have been designed that record a wide range of different signals such as temperature, CO2 levels, wind speed and many others. This required that the system be flexible enough to manage a range of sensors with different requirements.</p>
                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Project Breakdown (My Parts)</p>
                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Sensor to server communication:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">For this we decided on using the MQTT protocol as it is a publish-subscribe protocol rather than a client-server protocol meaning that we would have the ability to send new data to the frontend in real time without having to constantly poll the server to see if new data has been received for a particular sensor. I also designed the requests that sensors could make, as well as implementing the server side functionality for dealing with these requests.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Databases:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">Since this project required the storage of a large quantity of time-series data I opted to use MongoDB for storing the data produced by the sensors due to it’s flexibility allowing for the storage structures to be very easily changed in the future. It’s flexibility was also ideal for storing the time-series data which would look different depending on the sensor producing it. <br>    In order to store information about user accounts and sensors metadata I opted to use MariaDB as it’s ideal for relational data and optimised for relational queries.</p>
                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Data API:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This REST API is written in PHP and was designed to make it easy for the frontend to fetch a user’s data. Building separately from the website dashboard also means that in the future if we decide to add an app or allow other webservices access to the sensor and user data it will be a lot easier to do so.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Frontend:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">To enable users to view and analyse the data their sensors had collected, I built a website dashboard shown below. It integrates with the API mentioned above and also allows the user to easily manage their sensors, locations, and profile information.</p>

                    <p class="project-main-text">The sensors are now being designed and built by another student however before we started collaborating I designed my own sensors that could measure temperature, relative humidity, ambient light and barometric pressure. I started writing the code for these using the ESP-IDF however finish them before the other student joined the project. A 3D model of my design is shown below, where the large box on the left hand side is an ESP-32-S2. The connectors on the right would be for connecting a battery and connecting a charger.</p>

                    <p class="project-main-text">One of the main skills that this project has helped me to develop is in documenting my programming as I go along. I’ve had a couple of people show interest in joining the project in the future which has meant that I have to ensure all of my code is well documented and well organised so as to make it as painless as possible.</p>
