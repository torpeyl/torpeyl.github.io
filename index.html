                    <p>
                        I am a 3rd year Electronics and Information Engineering MEng student at Imperial College London. I enjoy triathlon in my spare time and working on personal electronics and programming projects.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="heading resume-header-1">Project Highlights:</p>
                    <p class="heading resume-header-2">Technical Market Indicators (Personal Project):</p>
                    <p class="resume-bullet-points">
                        • This project was an exploration of the most commonly used market indicators and how effective they are when applied to recent market data.<br>
                        • It also provided a good opportunity to develop my skills using some popular python libraries for time-series analysis, as well as to deepen my understanding of recent market trends.<br>
                        • The project was written in Python using pandas and seaborn.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Project Summary</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This is a project that I’ve been working on in my spare time with another electrical engineering student who is working predominantly on the sensors themselves. I’ve been responsible for the system architecture, as well as setting up the website, server and writing the APIs. Over the course of the project a number of different sensors have been designed that record a wide range of different signals such as temperature, CO2 levels, wind speed and many others. This required that the system be flexible enough to manage a range of sensors with different requirements.</p>
                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Project Breakdown (My Parts)</p>
                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Sensor to server communication:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">For this we decided on using the MQTT protocol as it is a publish-subscribe protocol rather than a client-server protocol meaning that we would have the ability to send new data to the frontend in real time without having to constantly poll the server to see if new data has been received for a particular sensor. I also designed the requests that sensors could make, as well as implementing the server side functionality for dealing with these requests.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Databases:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">Since this project required the storage of a large quantity of time-series data I opted to use MongoDB for storing the data produced by the sensors due to it’s flexibility allowing for the storage structures to be very easily changed in the future. It’s flexibility was also ideal for storing the time-series data which would look different depending on the sensor producing it. <br>    In order to store information about user accounts and sensors metadata I opted to use MariaDB as it’s ideal for relational data and optimised for relational queries.</p>
                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Data API:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This REST API is written in PHP and was designed to make it easy for the frontend to fetch a user’s data. Building separately from the website dashboard also means that in the future if we decide to add an app or allow other webservices access to the sensor and user data it will be a lot easier to do so.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Frontend:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">To enable users to view and analyse the data their sensors had collected, I built a website dashboard shown below. It integrates with the API mentioned above and also allows the user to easily manage their sensors, locations, and profile information.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Note about sensors:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">The sensors are now being designed and built by another student however before we started collaborating I designed my own sensors that could measure temperature, relative humidity, ambient light and barometric pressure. I started writing the code for these using the ESP-IDF however finish them before the other student joined the project. A 3D model of my design is shown below, where the large box on the left hand side is an ESP-32-S2. The connectors on the right would be for connecting a battery and connecting a charger.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Skills Development</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">One of the main skills that this project has helped me to develop is in documenting my programming as I go along. I’ve had a couple of people show interest in joining the project in the future which has meant that I have to ensure all of my code is well documented and well organised so as to make it as painless as possible.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Project Summary</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This was a project that I undertook on my own in the summer after my first year of university. The entire stage light was designed from scratch requiring me to develop my skills in a wide range of areas from CAD to PCB design to embedded software. <br>The goal of the project was to develop a small desktop stage light that could be controlled both manually or with a DMX controller. To enable manual control of the light I used a 1.8 inch LCD screen to display a colour wheel. A cursor was displayed on the screen and could be moved around using a joystick to select the LED colour and intensity. A further set of potentiometers allowed manual control of the direction the light was pointing, as well as allowing the user to select some preprogrammed light and motion sequences.</p>
                
                    <p class="heading project-header-1">PCB Design</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">The project began with testing constructing the electronics on a breadboard. This was particularly important as it was my first time using an LCD display. I also knew that it would be close in terms of whether the ATmega microcontroller would have enough processing power for everything I wanted to do with the project. However as I began working on the project the list of features I wanted to implement grew and thus I had to add another microcontroller.<br>Once I had the electronics tested I started putting together a schematic of the circuit using KiCad. From this schematic I designed a PCB which I got professionally manufactured. The schematic and CAD model of the PCB are shown below.</p>

                    <p class="project-main-text">The final version of this project had two microcontrollers. These were programmed in Atmel Studio using embedded C which required a in depth knowledge of the hardware being used. A key skill for developing low level code is the ability to quickly and efficiently navigate the processors datasheets and this project definitely helped me further develop these skills.<br>The image below is a screenshot of some of the code used by the main processor.</p>

                    <p class="project-main-text">Once I had designed the PCB for this project I knew how big the base of the stage light would have to be in order to accommodate it. I could therefore proceed with the main design for which I used Fusion 360. The parts were then 3D printed using an FDM printer. The image below shows the internals of the upper part of the light.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Project Summary</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This is a project that I've recently started as it's a good project for developing my skills in finance and algorithm design. It also provides my with an oppurtunity to further develop my machine learning skills by working with real world data. I started this project by exploring trading signals. To start with I look into the simple moving average and the exponential moving average. By using different window sizes and monitoring the cross over points, one can gain an insight as to whether a market is stable or breaking out.</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">After trying this I looked into support / resistance indicators. The theory behind this is that the support line indicates the lowest price that the stock has been at in the last window size (eg. 200 days). The resistance line marks the highest price that the stock has been at in the the last window size. The idea is that the future stock price is unlikely to breach these lines and thus if it spend consecutive days in the support tolerance then the stock is about to rise and the algorithm should buy. If the price stays within the resistance tolerance band for consecutive days then the algorithm should sell as the stock price is about to decrease. This is a very simple algorithm but can be successful with a select few stocks. An image of it being applyed to historical Google stock data is shown below.</p>

                    <p class="project-main-text">I also tried applying a linear regression model and k-nearest neighbours model to Google's historical stock data.</p>
