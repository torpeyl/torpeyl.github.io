                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Project Summary</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This is a project that I’ve been working on in my spare time with another electrical engineering student who is working predominantly on the sensors themselves. I’ve been responsible for the system architecture, as well as setting up the website, server and writing the APIs. Over the course of the project a number of different sensors have been designed that record a wide range of different signals such as temperature, CO2 levels, wind speed and many others. This required that the system be flexible enough to manage a range of sensors with different requirements.</p>
                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Project Breakdown (My Parts)</p>
                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Sensor to server communication:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">For this we decided on using the MQTT protocol as it is a publish-subscribe protocol rather than a client-server protocol meaning that we would have the ability to send new data to the frontend in real time without having to constantly poll the server to see if new data has been received for a particular sensor. I also designed the requests that sensors could make, as well as implementing the server side functionality for dealing with these requests.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Databases:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">Since this project required the storage of a large quantity of time-series data I opted to use MongoDB for storing the data produced by the sensors due to it’s flexibility allowing for the storage structures to be very easily changed in the future. It’s flexibility was also ideal for storing the time-series data which would look different depending on the sensor producing it. <br>    In order to store information about user accounts and sensors metadata I opted to use MariaDB as it’s ideal for relational data and optimised for relational queries.</p>
                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Data API:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This REST API is written in PHP and was designed to make it easy for the frontend to fetch a user’s data. Building separately from the website dashboard also means that in the future if we decide to add an app or allow other webservices access to the sensor and user data it will be a lot easier to do so.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-2">Frontend:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">To enable users to view and analyse the data their sensors had collected, I built a website dashboard shown below. It integrates with the API mentioned above and also allows the user to easily manage their sensors, locations, and profile information.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Note about sensors:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">The sensors are now being designed and built by another student however before we started collaborating I designed my own sensors that could measure temperature, relative humidity, ambient light and barometric pressure. I started writing the code for these using the ESP-IDF however finish them before the other student joined the project. A 3D model of my design is shown below, where the large box on the left hand side is an ESP-32-S2. The connectors on the right would be for connecting a battery and connecting a charger.</p>

                    <p class="project-main-text">One of the main skills that this project has helped me to develop is in documenting my programming as I go along. I’ve had a couple of people show interest in joining the project in the future which has meant that I have to ensure all of my code is well documented and well organised so as to make it as painless as possible.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Project Summary</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This was a project that I undertook on my own in the summer after my first year of university. The entire stage light was designed from scratch requiring me to develop my skills in a wide range of areas from CAD to PCB design to embedded software. <br>The goal of the project was to develop a small desktop stage light that could be controlled both manually or with a DMX controller. To enable manual control of the light I used a 1.8 inch LCD screen to display a colour wheel. A cursor was displayed on the screen and could be moved around using a joystick to select the LED colour and intensity. A further set of potentiometers allowed manual control of the direction the light was pointing, as well as allowing the user to select some preprogrammed light and motion sequences.</p>
                
                    <p class="heading project-header-1">PCB Design</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">The project began with testing constructing the electronics on a breadboard. This was particularly important as it was my first time using an LCD display. I also knew that it would be close in terms of whether the ATmega microcontroller would have enough processing power for everything I wanted to do with the project. However as I began working on the project the list of features I wanted to implement grew and thus I had to add another microcontroller.<br>Once I had the electronics tested I started putting together a schematic of the circuit using KiCad. From this schematic I designed a PCB which I got professionally manufactured. The schematic and CAD model of the PCB are shown below.</p>

These were programmed in Atmel Studio using embedded C which required a in depth knowledge of the hardware being used. A key skill for developing low level code is the ability to quickly and efficiently navigate the processors datasheets and this project definitely helped me further develop these skills.<br>The image below is a screenshot of some of the code used by the main processor.</p>

I could therefore proceed with the main design for which I used Fusion 360. The parts were then 3D printed using an FDM printer. The image below shows the internals of the upper part of the light.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Project Summary</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This is a project that I've recently started as it's a good project for developing my skills in finance and algorithm design. It also provides my with an oppurtunity to further develop my machine learning skills by working with real world data. I started this project by exploring trading signals. To start with I look into the simple moving average and the exponential moving average. By using different window sizes and monitoring the cross over points, one can gain an insight as to whether a market is stable or breaking out.</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">After trying this I looked into support / resistance indicators. The theory behind this is that the support line indicates the lowest price that the stock has been at in the last window size (eg. 200 days). The resistance line marks the highest price that the stock has been at in the the last window size. The idea is that the future stock price is unlikely to breach these lines and thus if it spend consecutive days in the support tolerance then the stock is about to rise and the algorithm should buy. If the price stays within the resistance tolerance band for consecutive days then the algorithm should sell as the stock price is about to decrease. This is a very simple algorithm but can be successful with a select few stocks. An image of it being applyed to historical Google stock data is shown below.</p>

                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Introduction</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This project was done after coming across a dataset used by one of the introductory Kaggle competitions (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data">Link to Kaggle</a>). The dataset contains sales information about the sales of fifty four convenience stores across Ecuador between 2013 and 2017. The dataset contains quite a lot of additional information about the stores, as well as some of the major events happening in Ecuador during the period that the data was recorded. For this reason I thought it would be fun analyze this particular dataset and see what data analysis techniques I could learn along the way.</p>
                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Preliminary Exploration of the Main Time Series Data</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">The main dataset contains the following columns:</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">id, date, store_nbr, family, sales, onpromotion</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">A complete description of the data can be found at the link above, but most is self-explanatory. The family column is a product category, the sales is the total number of products in that particular product category sold at the specified store and date. The onpromotion column is the number of those sales that were on promotion at the time.</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">A good starting point is to get a basic summary of the dataset. This is shown below:</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/Sales_Forecasting/train_dataset_summary_1.png" class="img-fluid modal-image" data-caption="Training Data Summary.">
                        <div class="image-caption">Training Data Summary.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="project-main-text">From this alone we can see that we have 54 stores as well as sales that range from 0 to 124,717 however the 50th percentile only 11, and the 75th percentile is only 195 suggesting we have mostly smaller stores with a couple of big ones. If we plot (the right hand graph below) all of the total daily sales against the store that generated them, we can see that this claim is indeed true. The page listed in the introductory section also provides a dataset that contains the location of each store so it would be interesting to include this in the analysis later on to see how location influences the size of the daily sales figures.</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">The left hand graph shown below is a scatter plot of the daily sales sorted by product category. From this we can see that the majority of categories have very low numbers of sales, with only a few major categories that dwarf the others. This makes sense when you see that the main categories are food and drink related as one would suspect. I will explore later on how these category sales change over time and during major event, as well as how the location of the store may impact the ratio in which goods are sold.</p>                    
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/Sales_Forecasting/train_eda-sales_vs_product_type_and_store_1.png" class="img-fluid modal-image" data-caption="Plots showing all of the sales in the dataset arranged by product category and store ID.">
                        <div class="image-caption">Plots showing all of the sales in the dataset arranged by product category and store ID.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="project-main-text">One of the ideas I wanted to establish early on was whether all sales between different stores moved together. Instinctively they would, however one store may increase in popularity to the detriment of another. Thus it’s important to plot the total sales for each store over time to verify this:</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/Sales_Forecasting/train_eda-daily_store_sales_vs_time_1.png" class="img-fluid modal-image" data-caption="A graph of sales over time, with every product category plotted separately.">
                        <div class="image-caption">A graph of sales over time, with every product category plotted separately.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This looks as though all of the store’s sales are moving in unison with a positive correlation, suggesting that location may not have too much of an impact on an individual store’s trend. The graph above is displaying a lot of information so I zoomed in on a specific time frame and added an average of all of the sales across all of the stores.</p>

                    <p class="project-main-text">Doing this has confirmed the above, but has also highlighted an interesting feature of the data. There is clearly a weekly cycle for all of the stores, with a peak on the weekends. We also know that in Ecuador employees are paid twice a month so we should keep this in mind for later as the graph above doesn’t obviously show this cycle. The other issue with the graph above is that the scale is the same for all of the product categories making it difficult to see some of the categories that have lower average sales. What we’re more interested in is how the sales of product categories change over time, particularly those that experience large changes in response to specific events. For this reason I have plotted the normalised the deviation of the sales from the rolling 28 day average below.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="project-main-text">I’ve also added a vertical line representing the Manabi earthquake, potentially the most major event that occurred during the period that this data covers. If we zoom in we can now see quite clearly which product categories experienced the greatest changes in response to the earthquake. At this stage I also added tooltips to make it easier to identify the product categories.</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/Sales_Forecasting/train_eda-product_categories_norm_abs_change_vs_time_7.png" class="img-fluid modal-image" data-caption="A more detailed view of the graph above but over a shorter timeframe.">
                        <div class="image-caption">A more detailed view of the graph above but over a shorter timeframe.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="project-main-text">We can see from this that the categories such as home care, personal care, cleaning and hardware experienced very sharp increases in the days following the earthquake, whilst categories such as alcoholic beverages and celebration experienced the opposite effect. This is information that could be used to predict how sales would react to other similar natural disasters.</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">The next thing I decided to do was to take a look at how oil prices might have an impact on spending habits, since Ecuador’s economy is very dependent on oil. The graph below shows oil prices against total sales.</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/Sales_Forecasting/oil_eda-oil_price_vs_total_sales_1.png" class="img-fluid modal-image" data-caption="Daily oil prices plotted against daily total sales and the sales trend.">
                        <div class="image-caption">Daily oil prices plotted against daily total sales and the sales trend.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="project-main-text">The most obvious observation is on the 2015 mark where there is a clear correlation between the fall in oil price and the total sales, however besides this it’s difficult to tell by eye if the correlation also exists during other time periods. This information will still be useful though and I’ll revisit when developing a forecasting model.</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">At this point I also thought it would be interesting to see if the region or type of store had an impact on the proportion of each product that was being sold there. For this reason I plotted a histogram showing the product category distribution for each cluster of stores. This is shown below.</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/Sales_Forecasting/train_eda-dist_of_sales_by_cluster_2.png" class="img-fluid modal-image" data-caption="Distribution of product sales by store cluster.">
                        <div class="image-caption">Distribution of product sales by store cluster.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This shows that for the most part the distributions are fairly similar with the same categories such as groceries and beverages making up a large proportion of sales in every region. However there are some interesting differences such as in the proportion of sales that are produce. This may reflect socio-economic factors in different regions.</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">A logical step to take in the analysis of time series data is to perform series decomposition to view the trend and seasonality. The results are below:</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/Sales_Forecasting/train_eda-add_seasonal_decompose_1.png" class="img-fluid modal-image" data-caption="Time series decomposition of the total sales.">
                        <div class="image-caption">Time series decomposition of the total sales.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="project-main-text">We clearly see from this that we are dealing with a non-stationary time series so this should be rectified when we develop our forecasting model.</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">We can verify the weekly seasonality that we found earlier by zooming in to give the graph below.</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/Sales_Forecasting/train_eda-add_seasonal_decompose_2.png" class="img-fluid modal-image" data-caption="A closer look at the graphs above to emphasise the weekly seasonality.">
                        <div class="image-caption">A closer look at the graphs above to emphasise the weekly seasonality.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="project-main-text">Finally I calculated the Pearson correlation matrix for all of the time series data.</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/Sales_Forecasting/train_eda-pearson_corr_matrix_1.png" class="img-fluid modal-image" data-caption="Pearson correlation matrix of the time series features.">
                        <div class="image-caption">Pearson correlation matrix of the time series features.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="project-main-text">We aren’t interested in the correlation between the id and oil value, however we can see that the correlation between sales and onpromotion is relatively strong at 0.43. This isn’t entirely unexpected but will be useful later.</p>
                    <p class="heading project-header-1">Sales Forecasting (GBM Model)</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">The official Kaggle competition requires one to forecast 16 days of future sales, using Root Mean Square Log Error (RMSLE) as the error function. For this reason I decided to do the same and submit my predictions to Kaggle for calculating the error.</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">The first model that I tried to use was from the lightgbm python library which simplifies the implementation of a gradient boosted trees. However before plugging the training the model, I had to develop some features that I thought would be useful. Besides the ones that are already part of the train dataset, I exploded the date to create a day of month, month of year, and year column. I also added day of year and is whether the current day is a weekend to see if this had any influence on the accuracy of the model. I then added a 7 day, 14 day, and 28 day lag. I finally also had to encode the product family as currently it’s categorical. This just involved assigning values to each product category. </p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">This first model had a validation RMSLE of 0.914. However when I submitted it on Kaggle for the test data it had a RMSLE of 2.182. This could either be because of an error in my model, or because the test data contained a week of sales that was very unusual or different from the validation weeks. I will have to look into this at a later point but for now I decided to look at the contribution that each feature was having towards the final model by looking at the feature weights. The following is a graph of these weights:</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/Sales_Forecasting/model_1_feature_gains_2.png" class="img-fluid modal-image" data-caption="Feature gains for the first forecasting attempt.">
                        <div class="image-caption">Feature gains for the first forecasting attempt.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="project-main-text">In order to improve this score the first thing I decided to do was run the model on the log of the sales instead of the absolute sales. The reason being that different product families have quite large difference in scale for obvious reasons, and by taking the log this should make the range of values for each product type more similar.</p>
                    <p class="project-main-text">After implementing this change, still using the same features, the validation RMSLE more than halved to 0.423. The submission RMSLE also dropped down to 1.376 which is a massive improvement. The feature gains stayed fairly similar.</p>

                    <p class="project-main-text">This project was part of the my 2nd year information programming module and the goal of it was to create a simple game that could be controlled using an FPGA  as a controller. The FPGA we used was the DE10-Lite development board by Intel which comes with a built in accelerometer thus allowing our game to be controlled by tilting the board. The project was also required to use an AWS EC2 instance which we used for adding multiplayer functionality, as well as keeping track of high scores.</p>           
                    <p class="project-main-text">My main role was in writing the game which was written in JavaScript, however I also worked on integrating the game with the FPGA which used UART to communicate with a python script running locally on the user’s device. I also helped with integrating the game with the EC2 instance. </p>
