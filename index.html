I’ve been responsible for the system architecture, as well as setting up the website, server and writing the APIs. Over the course of the project a number of different sensors have been designed that record a wide range of different signals such as temperature, CO2 levels, wind speed and many others. This required that the system be flexible enough to manage a range of sensors with different requirements.</p>

                                            <p>The goal of the project was to develop a small desktop stage light that could be controlled both manually or with a DMX controller. To enable manual control of the light I used a 1.8 inch LCD screen to display a colour wheel. A cursor was displayed on the screen and could be moved around using a joystick to select the LED colour and intensity. A further set of potentiometers allowed manual control of the direction the light was pointing, as well as allowing the user to select some preprogrammed light and motion sequences.</p>

                                            <p>This project was part of the my 2nd year information programming module and the goal of it was to create a simple game that could be controlled using an FPGA as a controller. The FPGA we used was the DE10-Lite development board by Intel which comes with a built in accelerometer thus allowing our game to be controlled by tilting the board. The project was also required to use an AWS EC2 instance which we used for adding multiplayer functionality, as well as keeping track of high scores.</p>
                                            <p>My main role was in writing the game which was written in JavaScript, however I also worked on integrating the game with the FPGA which used UART to communicate with a python script running locally on the user’s device. I also helped with integrating the game with the EC2 instance.</p>

The dataset contains sales information about the sales of fifty four convenience stores across Ecuador between 2013 and 2017. The dataset contains quite a lot of additional information about the stores, as well as some of the major events happening in Ecuador during the period that the data was recorded. For this reason I thought it would be fun analyze this particular dataset and see what data analysis techniques I could learn along the way.</p>

                                            <p>Around 3% of the UK population are diagnosed with cardiacvascular diseases each year making them one of the most common types of diseases. An important component in assessing the health of these patients is the use of Cardiac MRI (CMRI) scans to identify regions of myocardial fibrosis (scarred muscle tissue). he tissue surrounding the left ventricle is of particular interest, since many diseases such as hypertension and aortic stenosis primarily affect this region. Being able to quickly identify myocardial fibrosis is therefore very important to medical professionals.</p>
                                            <p>For these reasons the goal of this project was to develop an image segmentation model that could as accurately as possible identify regions of myocardial fibrosis. The only restriction placed on the project was that the only that could be used was a dataset containing 400 scans, provided by a clinical collaborator. The final model used a two stage approach that was first trained to identify the myocardium tissue, and then use this to produce a more refined scar tissue mask. Each of the stages made use of a hybrid transformer-cnn model, loosely based on the MaxVit architecture.</p>
