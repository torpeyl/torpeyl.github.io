project list:

1 - IOT Environment Sensors
2 - Stage Light
3 - Maze Solving Balancing Rover
4 - Tetris FPGA Game Controller
5 - System Verilog CPU Design
6 - Algorithmic Trading Experimentation
7 - Post Letter Sorter - Experiments in Computer Vision (In Development)
8 - Market Indicators
9 - Supermarket Sales Forecasting
10 - Computer Vision (Third Year Module)
11 - Time Series Statistical Analysis
12 - Deep Learning for CMRI Scar Segmentation
13 - Automated Patient Triage


Todo:

+ Add captions to images
+ Add the captions to the image modal
+ Add 3rd year summer project
+ Add maze solving balancing rover
+ Relook into market indicators code and maybe write page for it

+ Add intro to ml decision tree project to page.
+ Add System Verilog Page
+ Add second year summer project page
+ Add time series analysis page
+ Add third year summer project page

+ Improve background by adding either an animation or geometric shapes that do something fancy
+ Modify the overall design to make use of multiple html files
+ Ensure the site works on all screens



+ A fun idea for a background would be a simple unet model or something similar that is processing mnist images, showing the progression of the input image to the output, whilst also being interactive so as the users mouse moves, the model rotates in 3D space.
